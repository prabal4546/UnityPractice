# unity-swiftui

This is a _reference project_ for how to integrate [Unity as a Library](https://unity.com/features/unity-as-a-library) with a SwiftUI iOS app. Unity's [existing iOS documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/uaal-example/blob/master/docs/ios.md) only demonstrates UAAL with UIKit/Objective-C projects and lacks illustrative examples of native-to-unity state flow, control of the Unity view, and automated integration of Unity's build output.

## Requirements

- Physical device with iOS 17.0 or later.
- Unity Editor 2022.3.52f1 - latest LTS as of Nov 6, 2024 - with iOS build support installed in Unity Hub.

## Instructions

1. **Clone repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bdeweygit/unity-swiftui.git
    cd unity-swiftui
    ```

2. **Create build folder for Unity project**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p UnityProject/Builds/iOS
    ```

3. **Open and build Unity project**
    - Use Unity Hub to open `UnityProject` directory.
    - Go to `File` > `Build Settings`.
    - In platform menu, select `iOS` and click `Switch Platform`.
    - Click `Build` and choose `Builds/iOS` folder you created earlier.

4. **Open integration workspace**
    - Use Xcode to open `integration.xcworkspace` file.

5. **Configure SwiftUI project**
    - Edit `UnitySwiftUI` target's signing settings with valid bundle identifier and signing team ID.
    - Switch to `UnitySwiftUI` scheme.

6. **Run on physical device**
    - Connect your device to Xcode.
    - Build and run `UnitySwiftUI` scheme on your device.

## Key features

- Control of Unity view as a SwiftUI element that can be repositioned and resized. Unity's [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/UnityasaLibrary-iOS.html) says "Unity as a Library only supports full-screen rendering, and doesnâ€™t support rendering on part of the screen." This limitation has been fixed.
- Touches and gestures on Unity view are processed within Unity.
- Restarting the Unity player.
- State is sent from native Swift to Unity C# as a struct with members including string, boolean, floating point, integer, and MTLTexture types.

## Key files

### SwiftUI Project

- [**Unity.swift**](SwiftUIProject/UnitySwiftUI/Unity.swift): Class for controlling Unity framework and native-to-unity state flow.
- [**ContentView.swift**](SwiftUIProject/UnitySwiftUI/ContentView.swift): UI demonstrating Unity view as a SwiftUI element and controls for layout and state.

### Unity Project

- [**NativeStateManager.cs**](UnityProject/Assets/Scripts/NativeStateManager.cs): Class for receiving and storing native state.
- [**RootBehavior.cs**](UnityProject/Assets/Scripts/RootBehavior.cs): Script that renders sample scene - cube and spotlight - reacting to state updates and touch events.
- [**NativeState.h**](UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/iOS/NativeState.h), [**NativeState.m**](UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/iOS/NativeState.m): Plugin enabling flow of state from native Swift to Unity C#.
- [**UnityFramework.modulemap**](UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/iOS/UnityFramework.modulemap): Custom modulemap for plugin interoperability with Swift.
- [**PostProcessBuild.cs**](UnityProject/Assets/Editor/PostProcessBuild.cs): Script automating integration of Unity generated Xcode project.

If you want to adapt an existing project based on the [**plugin**](UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/iOS/NativeState.h), you will likely need to disable Xcode's `Thread Performance Checker` under `Product` > `Scheme` > `Edit Scheme` > `Run` > `Diagnostics` > `Runtime API Checking`. The [**Unity.swift**](SwiftUIProject/UnitySwiftUI/Unity.swift) file has a comment explaining this.

## Known issues

- After building Unity project, Xcode workspace may not always reflect latest files and be unable to build. Close and reopen workspace to fix this.
- When running while attached to Xcode, there may be some noticeable delay between device orientation change and UI layout. There should be no such delay when running detached.
- If you start a native animation and some kind of Unity effect with identical physics at the same time, they will gradually fall out-of-sync due to ongoing phase shift between the native and Unity render loops, even if FPS is the same. In a private project I have mitigated this by directly editing files in Unity's build output to take control of driving the Unity render loop, but this is a risky and difficult hack to perform correctly.

## Wish list

Potential improvements to the project. These are good challenges if you want to contribute.

- Get SwiftUI project to run on the simulator.
- Get Unity project to run in the Unity Editor. Technically it does run, but it does so without native state on which the scene relies. See the `#if !UNITY_EDITOR` preprocessor directive in [**NativeStateManager.cs**](UnityProject/Assets/Scripts/NativeStateManager.cs).
- Add support for transparent background in the Unity view. Will this ruin some of Unity's shaders?
- Deallocate native textures when Unity is stopped. If we're not going to load the textures until Unity starts, then it makes sense to unload them when Unity stops. What is an elegant way to do this without causing a null pointer exception when Unity is restarted?
- Hide [**plugin's**](UnityProject/Assets/Plugins/iOS/NativeState.m) `RegisterNativeStateSetter` function from C#. This function should only be called from Swift, but it can still be imported and called from C#. Can we prevent this?
- Convert from a reference project to a plugin. Goal would be to make integration as easy as installing some plugins. Is this even possible? Would it be a Unity plugin with an accompanying SwiftPM package? How will it accommodate arbitrary state structure?
- Add tests. What can/should we verify with tests? Do we need a separate suite in each of the SwiftUI and Unity projects, or something more unified?
